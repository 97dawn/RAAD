Script Process:
1. Install MongoDB, and all the dependencies and related libraries in requirements.txt, including pymongo.
2. From backend, import hash_utils.py.
3. Ask the user for a password.
4. Call hash_utils.generate_salt() to get a random salt.
5. Store the salt into with hash_utils.store_salt( salt ).
6. Call hash_utils.hmac_hash( user_password, salt ) to get a hexidecimal digest.
7. Call hash_utils.store_password( hexdigest ) to store the digest of the hash.
8. Run the front end, backend, and log processor.
